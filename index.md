This outfit is fronted by a guy called Mark, who was operating as Carlow Roofing and Guttering and now also seems to be using the name MO Roofing and Miley (you will see that MO Roofing’s Facebook page refers to carlowroofing.ie if you scroll to some of the older posts).

These guys are experts alright, but it isn’t in roofing. It’s in getting your money out of you.

We have a roof recently built by these clowns that needs to be taken off and replaced because it isn’t structurally sound.
Beams used were not of the correct thickness. 
Multiple lengths of wood were connected together in ways that are not appropriate for bearing load.
The roof as a whole was not secured down correctly and may blow off.
Drainage of water off the roof was not addressed.

In addition to these major issues there were some comparatively minor issues, such as the fact that significant debris and material was left and some of the work was not completed.

They ghosted us right after receiving payment and won’t now respond to calls or messages.

Afterwards, we learned that we are not the only people who have had similar experiences of jobs done by Carlow Roofing/MO Roofing needing expensive rework. The Gardai have apparently been called on them, to no avail.

If you’re considering hiring these people, note that you won’t find a physical address, full names of the owners, an official company name, or details of any CIRI registration on their website. Bear in mind also that they’ve just changed their name for some reason. Proceed with extreme caution.
